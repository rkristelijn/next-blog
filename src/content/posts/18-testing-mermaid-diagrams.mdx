# Testing Mermaid Diagrams in Blog Posts

This post tests the Mermaid diagram functionality in our blog. Mermaid allows us to create diagrams and flowcharts using simple text syntax.

## Simple Flowchart

Here's a basic flowchart showing a decision process:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Start] --> B{Is it working?}
    B -->|Yes| C[Great!]
    B -->|No| D[Debug]
    D --> E[Fix Issue]
    E --> B
    C --> F[End]
```

## Git Workflow Diagram

This diagram shows our new branch protection workflow:

```mermaid
gitGraph
    commit id: "Initial"
    commit id: "Feature 1"
    
    branch feature/new-feature
    checkout feature/new-feature
    commit id: "Work in progress"
    commit id: "Feature complete"
    
    checkout main
    commit id: "Hotfix"
    
    checkout feature/new-feature
    merge main
    commit id: "Merge main"
    
    checkout main
    merge feature/new-feature
    commit id: "Merge PR"
```

## Sequence Diagram

Here's how the fork management process works:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant F as Fork
    participant M as Main Repo
    participant CI as GitHub Actions
    
    U->>F: Create fork
    U->>F: Add personal content
    U->>F: Make improvements
    F->>M: Create pull request
    M->>CI: Run automated checks
    CI->>M: Validation results
    M->>M: Review and selective merge
    M->>F: Provide feedback
```

## Class Diagram

The architecture of our blog system:

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Post {
        +string title
        +string date
        +string author
        +string excerpt
        +string content
        +string slug
        +getSlug()
        +validate()
    }
    
    class PostService {
        +getAllPosts()
        +getPostBySlug()
        +generatePostsData()
    }
    
    class MermaidComponent {
        +string chart
        +string id
        +render()
    }
    
    PostService --> Post
    Post --> MermaidComponent : uses
```

## Pie Chart

Distribution of our documentation types:

```mermaid
pie title Documentation Types
    "Technical Docs" : 40
    "User Guides" : 30
    "Troubleshooting" : 20
    "Examples" : 10
```

## State Diagram

The lifecycle of a blog post:

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Draft
    Draft --> Review : Submit
    Review --> Published : Approve
    Review --> Draft : Needs Changes
    Published --> Archived : Archive
    Archived --> Published : Restore
    Published --> [*] : Delete
```

## Journey Map

User experience with our blog template:

```mermaid
journey
    title User Journey with Blog Template
    section Discovery
      Find template: 5: User
      Read documentation: 4: User
      Fork repository: 5: User
    section Setup
      Configure secrets: 3: User
      First deployment: 2: User
      Troubleshoot issues: 1: User
      Get help: 4: User
    section Usage
      Write first post: 5: User
      Add images: 4: User
      Customize theme: 3: User
      Share blog: 5: User
```

## Testing Different Themes

These diagrams should automatically adapt to both light and dark themes. The Mermaid component uses the current Material-UI theme to configure colors and styling.

### Features Tested:
- ✅ Flowcharts with decision nodes
- ✅ Git graphs with branches and merges
- ✅ Sequence diagrams with multiple participants
- ✅ Class diagrams with relationships
- ✅ Pie charts with data visualization
- ✅ State diagrams with transitions
- ✅ Journey maps with emotional states
- ✅ Theme-aware rendering (light/dark mode)
- ✅ Responsive design for mobile devices

## Code Example

For comparison, here's regular code syntax highlighting:

```javascript
// Regular code block (not Mermaid)
function generateMermaidId() {
  return `mermaid-${Math.random().toString(36).substr(2, 9)}`;
}

console.log('This should be syntax highlighted, not rendered as a diagram');
```

And here's some TypeScript:

```typescript
interface MermaidProps {
  chart: string;
  id?: string;
}

const MermaidComponent: React.FC<MermaidProps> = ({ chart, id }) => {
  // Component implementation
  return <div>Mermaid diagram here</div>;
};
```

## Conclusion

If you can see properly rendered diagrams above (not just code blocks), then Mermaid integration is working correctly! The diagrams should:

1. **Render as visual diagrams** instead of code blocks
2. **Adapt to the current theme** (light/dark mode)
3. **Be responsive** and work on mobile devices
4. **Handle errors gracefully** if there are syntax issues

This enables us to create rich, visual documentation and blog posts with flowcharts, architecture diagrams, and process flows directly in Markdown.
