# Contributing to Next.js Blog Template

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This document outlines the process for contributing to this project.

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch
3. Make your changes
4. Submit a pull request

## üìã Contribution Workflow

### 1. Setup Your Development Environment

```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub, then clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/next-blog.git
cd next-blog

# Add upstream remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/rkristelijn/next-blog.git

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

### 2. Create a Feature Branch

**Important:** Never work directly on the `main` branch. Always create a feature branch.

```bash
# Ensure you're on main and up to date
git checkout main
git pull upstream main

# Create and switch to a new feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

#### Branch Naming Conventions:
- `feature/add-new-functionality` - New features
- `fix/resolve-deployment-issue` - Bug fixes  
- `docs/update-user-manual` - Documentation updates
- `refactor/improve-code-structure` - Code improvements
- `chore/update-dependencies` - Maintenance tasks

### 3. Make Your Changes

- Write clear, concise commit messages
- Follow existing code style and conventions
- Add tests if applicable
- Update documentation as needed

```bash
# Make your changes
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add comprehensive user guide for web interface"
```

### 4. Test Your Changes

Before submitting, ensure your changes work:

```bash
# Run diagnostics
npm run diagnose

# Test posts generation
node scripts/generate-posts-data.js

# Run linting
npm run lint

# Test build
npm run ci:build
```

### 5. Submit a Pull Request

```bash
# Push your branch to your fork
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

Then create a pull request through GitHub's interface.
